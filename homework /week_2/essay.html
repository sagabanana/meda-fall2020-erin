<h1>The Double Standard of Aging</h1>
<h2>by:<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Sontag"> Susan Sontang</a></h2>

<p>The Double Standard is a paragraph about how women should create their own standards instead of following the steryotypes set by society.</p>
<h3>The Double standard of aging goes over points such as:</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Women can aspire to be wise, not merely nice; to be competent, not merely helpful; to be strong, not merely graceful</li>
    <li>They can let themselves age naturally and without embarrassment, actively protesting and disobeying the conventions that stem from this societyâ€™s double standard about aging.</li>
    <li>Women should allow their faces to show the lives they have lived. Women should tell the truth.</li>
</ul>
