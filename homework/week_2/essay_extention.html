<h1>Ar Scáth a cheile a mhaireas na daoine</h1>

<p>The Irish proverb 'Ar Scáth a cheile a mhaireas na daoine.' translates to English, 'It is in the shelter of each other that the people live.' and equally, 'It is also in the shadow of each other that the people live.'  The poet Micheal O'Siadhail, also a linguist, wrote once that 'scáth' is related to a Norwegian word for 'mist'. He continued, 'I wonder if the wisdom in this proverb demands a kind of discernment, a peering through the blur of ordinary living to decide when closenss overshadows and when it protects.'</p>
 
<h3>What does this mean? Let's take a look</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Our shelter can be our shadow</li>
    <li>What shelters me may shadow you </li>
    <li>We can do beautiful things and terrible things to ourselves and to those we consider to be 'our others'.</li>
</ul>
