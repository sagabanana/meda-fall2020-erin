    <h2>I have always been drawn to words.</h2>

    <p>I remember I would get up with a word or words, a sentence(s), a phrase(s) which caused me to look up those words as soon as I get up or these word(s) would remain in me all day or days.  I felt comfort in finding answers, getting clarity from ambiguity and messiness and a solution to satisfaction - understanding - these were done through simply reading, writing and reflecting, alone.  a word after a word made a sentence, a paragraph to paragraphs, a page to pages, a article to articles to a book.  These collection of words made sense to me when things went really blurry and dark around me. Here are some words, phrases, scriptures ... etc. that I collected in the past.</p> 
    <p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Catcher_in_the_Rye">The Catcher in the Rye</a> is a novel by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Salinger"> J.D. Salinger</a>, the message on this page 246 resonated with me</p>

    <p>I visited a Hindu temple and saw this Bhagavad Gita scripture framed on the wall. (Below)</p>

I found it to be ironic, absurd, mind-boggling and funny</p> <p>(R)I was at a conference and one of the speakers shared Alan Turing's words - meaningful.</p><img src="robertfrost.jpg" alt="By working faithfully eight hours a day, you may eventually get to be a boss and work twelve hours a day." title="Robert Frost's words" height="600" width="450"/>

    <p>Hermann Hesse speaks to me deeply, precisely.  I admire his writing and here is one of his timeless words from <a href="https://www.nitch.com/notes/1550255518" target="_blank"> nitch.com</a> </p><img src="hermannhonor.jpg" alt="It is not our purpose to become each other; it is to recognize each other, to learn to see the other and honor him for what he is." height="600" width="450"/>
    
    <h3>Not meant to be a hobby</h3>
    <p>I don't think these word-search-finding answer-sharing activities were meant to become a hobby, but it became one, unintentionally - I find myself doing it in my spare time. Even when I am occupied, my mind wonders to a different dimension where I wander about wonders, searching for meaning or trying to understand what I am doing, unsure about and how it applies to me at that very moment.  This activity became a big part of me, as people might call it "hobby" - how do I do it? By being curious, asking questions, trying to understand, start reading as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman">Feynman</a> taught his students, <a href="https://mystudentvoices.com/feynman-technique-learn-and-retain-information-effectively-bfe37b642c9e" target="_blank"> "Study hard what interests you the most in the undisciplined, irreverent and original manner possible."</a> This 'undisciplined, irreverent and original manner' to me is the easiest task I could find to flow into.</p>  
    
    <h4>How did I start this and why am I doing it?</h4> 
    <p>There are numerous reasons that I can think of but just to say a few 
        
    <ul>
        <li>I read because I felt a strong need for connection.</li> 
        <li>I read because I felt pain.</li>  
        <li>I read because it was calming and enjoyable. </li> <li>I read because it organized my thoughts and feelings.</li>  
        <li>I read because I was curious to know how to live life by reading other great people who lived before me and are living now.</li>
        
    </ul>

    <p>All this lead me to start collecting words, quotes, pages, paintings, animations, poems and whatever I stumble acrossed which I knew yet I was unable to articulate them but there they were already written and expressed before my eyes.  It's like a piece of me that was lost and found through these words of men and women in the past and now across the world.  I saved them in
        <ul>
            <li>my notes</li>
            <li>my photo albums</li>
            <li>my diary</li>
            <li>social medias</li>
            <li>any place that could be stored, saved and shared</li>
        </ul>
